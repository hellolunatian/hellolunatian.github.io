<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I wonder—oh, in this society, doing something completely normal is enough to make you an outlier.<br>I didn’t do anything big. I just cut through a few locks. I only wanted to step out of the building, to breathe some fresh air.<br>But in some people’s eyes, that alone made me a “problem.”<br>Oh—so this society really has retreated to a point where there’s no further ground left to lose.</p>
<p>In a time of systemic dysfunction, doing the right thing often comes at an unimaginable cost.<br>This was meant to be an old post, but my previous blog was taken down before I had the chance to publish it. Today, I’m sharing it at last.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="I-A-Silent-Autumn"><a href="#I-A-Silent-Autumn" class="headerlink" title="I. A Silent Autumn"></a>I. A Silent Autumn</h2><p>In September 2022, I returned to a university in Hohhot for the new semester.<br>It was a semester that, from the beginning, would never unfold normally.</p>
<p>The campus gates were locked shortly after classes began—no one was allowed in or out. Then came harsher restrictions: we weren’t allowed to leave our dormitory building, showers were inaccessible, food supplies were scarce, and classes moved online. We were suspended in time, as if forgotten.</p>
<p>In late October, after the Inner Mongolia Party Secretary visited the campus, the school suddenly launched a “relocation” plan, gradually sending students back to their hometowns.<br>It marked an ending—but also the start of a new kind of uncertainty.</p>
<p>On October 30, I returned to Hebei and entered a seven-day quarantine.<br>On November 6, I finally made it home.<br>But the lockdown in my residential complex was even more suffocating than it had been at school.</p>
<p>Within a few days, I realized: I hadn’t truly come home.</p>
<h2 id="II-The-“Dog-Hole”-That-Brought-Us-Air"><a href="#II-The-“Dog-Hole”-That-Brought-Us-Air" class="headerlink" title="II. The “Dog Hole” That Brought Us Air"></a>II. The “Dog Hole” That Brought Us Air</h2><p>Our compound was in complete silence. The lockdown was extended indefinitely. Everyone was forced to stay indoors. COVID tests were carried out two or three times a day, with lines starting as early as 4 a.m.<br>The grocery delivery system was a joke. Most residents had to survive on government rations: carrots, cabbage, and potatoes. Meat disappeared from our diets altogether.</p>
<p>Our community WeChat group overflowed with complaints. People kept asking, “How much longer will this go on?”<br>The property management never responded.<br>Though the authorities repeatedly warned against excessive enforcement, our community acted like a world of its own—treating those orders as irrelevant.</p>
<p>People were pushed to the edge.<br>This wasn’t just about freedom. It was about survival—and dignity.<br>Many of my neighbors were day laborers. If they couldn’t leave the house, they had no way to make a living.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere, I quietly discussed a plan with a neighbor from the group chat.<br>Behind our building, pressed against a corner of the wall, was a stretch of chain-link fence. If we could open it, it might offer a much-needed exit for some.</p>
<p>We weren’t radicals. We just thought someone needed to come up with a way out.</p>
<p>So at 2 a.m. on a dark, windy night, I took a pair of bolt cutters and wire snips and snuck out the back path behind the building.<br>A neighbor messaged me on WeChat: “That fence isn’t monitored. What if we just cut a hole?”<br>I replied after a moment: “Funny, I was thinking the same thing.”</p>
<p>By then, I was used to living in this kind of limbo.<br>Strangely, I even felt a thrill—like I was about to do something wrong.<br>My fingers were numb from the cold, but I could still hear the sound of metal meeting metal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a strong fence. Within minutes, I had carved out an opening just wide enough for someone to squeeze through sideways.<br>I didn’t think I was doing anything big.<br>I just thought—we needed a way out.<br>Even if it was just to go buy a bottle of water. Even just to breathe.</p>
<p>The next day, someone went through the hole. The day after that, more people quietly slipped out.</p>
<p>I knew it would be discovered. But I also knew it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Soon, people in the group chat started asking who had opened the “dog hole.”<br>They said it finally gave them a breath of fresh air.<br>Reading those messages, I smiled.</p>
<p>A few days later, the property managers noticed.<br>They didn’t say a word.<br>They just silently locked the stairwell gate.</p>
<p>This time it wasn’t a flimsy tape seal.<br>They used a real lock—a bike chain lock—to secure the iron gate.<br>The gap between the two layers of metal doors was sealed shut.</p>
<p>There were elderly people in our building. Children. Diabetics.<br>I began to worry: What if there was a fire? There’d be no way out.</p>
<p>I went downstairs to check the lock.<br>Then I looked up at the position of the surveillance camera and had a rough idea of what I needed to do.</p>
<p>I went back upstairs and posted in the WeChat group:<br>“This won’t do. What if there’s a fire? If none of you dare to cut it, I will.”</p>
<p>No one replied. No one stopped me.</p>
<p>That night, I took my tools, went downstairs, and cut the lock.<br>The door clanged open.<br>I didn’t run. I didn’t hide.<br>I just put the wire cutters back in my backpack and walked upstairs.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first lock I’d cut.<br>Back in April that year, I’d cut one before—and the property manager just summoned me for a “chat.”<br>I thought this time would be the same.</p>
<p>But clearly, I had made a serious miscalculation.</p>
<h2 id="III-That’s-It—I-Got-Taken-Away"><a href="#III-That’s-It—I-Got-Taken-Away" class="headerlink" title="III. That’s It—I Got Taken Away"></a>III. That’s It—I Got Taken Away</h2><p>The story of the cut lock spread quickly.<br>The property management checked the surveillance footage and began knocking on doors.<br>Some people quietly left the group chat. Others went uncharacteristically silent.</p>
<p>At first, I thought no one would turn me in.<br>After all, the hole in the fence wasn’t just for me—it was for everyone.</p>
<p>But I soon realized that in a system like this, silence is never protection.</p>
<p>Not long after, I got a call from the local Public Security Bureau.<br>The officer spoke in a flat tone. He said they wanted to “clarify a few things” and asked if I’d been involved in the lock-cutting.</p>
<p>I didn’t deny it.<br>I said, “Yes, I cut it. I don’t want anyone else to get blamed.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then he said:<br>“Come to the station.”</p>
<p>But I never made it there.</p>
<p>The next day, I got another call—this time from the community health authorities.<br>They told me I’d tested positive for COVID and had to be transferred to quarantine immediately.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell whether the test result was real, or part of a strategy.<br>I had no symptoms. I hadn’t been in contact with anyone who was positive.</p>
<p>But I knew this wasn’t something I could argue about.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I packed a change of clothes and a toothbrush.<br>I was taken away in a white van.<br>The driver wore full protective gear and didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>I sat in the last row, watching the empty streets pass by outside.<br>The city looked like a silent stage.</p>
<p>The quarantine site was a hotel that had been temporarily requisitioned by the authorities. The room was small, but clean.<br>The first day passed quietly. No one came to bother me.<br>The food was simple but sufficient.<br>For a moment, I even thought this might just be a short “technical quarantine.”</p>
<p>Until the morning of the third day.</p>
<p>A staff member in uniform knocked on my door.<br>He handed me a sheet of paper and said I had to surrender my phone.<br>There was no malice in his tone, but I understood: once I handed it over, I would be completely cut off from the outside world.</p>
<p>I asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>He said, “Higher-ups’ orders. Please cooperate with the investigation.”</p>
<p>I handed over my phone.<br>It felt like surrendering a weapon of self-defense.</p>
<p>From that day on, the phone calls began.<br>Every day.<br>Sometimes the voices were calm, other times aggressive.<br>I figured they must have plenty of free time.<br>The economy was tanking, chaos was everywhere, yet here they were, spending resources on this—on me.<br>Listening to their voices, I sometimes found myself drifting into daydreams.</p>
<p>They asked if I had incited residents to escape.<br>If I had posted anti-government comments online.<br>They brought up my criticisms on Weibo about Hohhot’s pandemic measures—the prolonged transfers in sealed buses, students forced to wear hazmat suits and ride for hours.<br>One of them said, “This isn’t your first time, is it?”</p>
<p>I knew they had dug through my old accounts, my blogs—even posts I had deleted.<br>They said I had a “record.”<br>That this was just “a convenient cleanup.”<br>A little reminder to keep me in line.</p>
<p>So I said yes.<br>I told them their people had spoken to me before, had invited me for “a cup of tea.”<br>And I said I cooperated back then, too.</p>
<p>They asked if I knew what I’d done wrong.<br>I said, “I damaged public property. Sorry about that. I guess that lock was pretty expensive.”</p>
<p>On the other end of the line, someone muttered a few things—<br>That I was like an iron ball in a pot of stew:<br>Impervious to oil or salt.</p>
<p>I hadn’t had meat in days, and hearing that made me feel oddly hungry.</p>
<p>After that, they stopped bringing me meals for two days.</p>
<p>I asked about it.<br>They just said, “All delivered.”</p>
<p>I didn’t argue.<br>I just drank tap water.<br>Slept.</p>
<p>I learned to conserve energy.<br>I also learned how not to think.</p>
<p>Every couple of days, someone came by for a “conversation.”<br>Because there was no other human interaction, I almost looked forward to these visits.</p>
<p>They always said the same thing:<br>“People like you—if you don’t repent, you know what the consequences will be.”</p>
<p>One time, they brought up an old colleague of mine—another independent journalist—who had been sentenced for “inciting subversion” after criticizing the government.</p>
<p>They said, “Keep this up, and you’ll be next.”</p>
<h2 id="IV-The-Change-Came-Without-a-Sound"><a href="#IV-The-Change-Came-Without-a-Sound" class="headerlink" title="IV. The Change Came Without a Sound"></a>IV. The Change Came Without a Sound</h2><p>On the morning of December 26, I was still in my room when I heard a knock at the door just as the sky began to brighten.<br>Two people in hazmat suits stood outside—but this time, they weren’t wearing hoods, only masks and clear face shields.</p>
<p>They said, “You can leave now. The pandemic policy has changed.”</p>
<p>I didn’t react right away.<br>Then they added, “Your quarantine is over. But the investigation is just beginning.”</p>
<p>I was taken to the local police station for a final round of “questioning.”<br>Like before, there were no handcuffs, no insults.<br>(I don’t know if others being questioned received the same treatment—I hope they did. 🙏)</p>
<p>But it was incredibly long.</p>
<p>They had me recount every detail of my return home from Inner Mongolia.<br>They asked me to sign documents, give a recorded statement—twenty pages in total.</p>
<p>They powered on my phone, used a special device to back up my photos, reviewed chat logs, and noted down my social media accounts.<br>I sat there like a piece of evidence waiting to be catalogued.</p>
<p>Finally, they asked me:<br>“Are you loyal to the Chinese Communist Party?”</p>
<p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>At that moment, I just wanted to get out of there.</p>
<h2 id="V-Troublemaker"><a href="#V-Troublemaker" class="headerlink" title="V. Troublemaker"></a>V. Troublemaker</h2><p>Eventually, I was released.<br>No written punishment. No public announcement.<br>But later, when I went to the neighborhood committee to pay my property fees, I accidentally saw an open Excel file on their screen.</p>
<p>In the far-right comment column, next to my name, in bold red characters, it read: “Troublemaker.”</p>
<p>In that instant, I didn’t feel angry.<br>Just an almost absurd sense of relief.</p>
<p>I thought: finally—they’ve given me a definition.</p>
<p>When friends found out, they sometimes joked:<br>“Oh, I won’t argue with you—you’re a troublemaker. Come on, tell me—are you a citizen journalist or a troublemaker journalist?”</p>
<p>Most of the time I’d just laugh and say nothing.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve seen enough of the bad in this world that I’ve become weirdly optimistic.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think they’re childish.<br>Sometimes I think they’re ridiculous.<br>But sometimes—I feel afraid.</p>
<p>Later, I was diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
<p>Sometimes I still think—oh, in this society, doing something completely normal is enough to make you an outlier.<br>I didn’t do anything big. I just cut a few locks.<br>I just wanted to leave that building, to feel some fresh air.<br>But in some people’s eyes, that alone made me a “problem.”</p>
<p>So this is how far our society has regressed—backed into a corner, with nowhere left to retreat.</p>
<p>Eventually, I left China.<br>I came to a place that is, at least for now, relatively safe.<br>But even so, those days still cling to me like a taut string, always humming under my skin.</p>
<p>I know I’m safe now.<br>But I don’t know how long this safety will last.</p>
<p>Because they’ve already taught me one thing:<br>Back there, you could be labeled at any time.<br>Whenever they needed someone, you could become raw material.<br>That’s how I became material—for wanting a breath of air.</p>
