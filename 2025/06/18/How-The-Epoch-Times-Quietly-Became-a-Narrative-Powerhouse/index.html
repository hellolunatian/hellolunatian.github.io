<p>It all started with a Swedish news article.<br>From that moment, I began to sense the outlines of a silent global campaign to reshape public discourse.</p>
<h2 id="I-News-like-Appearances-A-Report-and-a-Name"><a href="#I-News-like-Appearances-A-Report-and-a-Name" class="headerlink" title="I. News-like Appearances | A Report and a Name"></a>I. News-like Appearances | A Report and a Name</h2><p>Some stories don’t catch your attention because they scream; they stop you precisely because of how quietly they speak.</p>
<p>Let me begin with a report I stumbled upon—a well-written piece about a Chinese dissident living in Sweden. The subject was a Mongolian rights advocate, persecuted for defending minority language education in China. After speaking out abroad against Beijing’s suppression of Mongolian culture, his family back home came under direct threat.</p>
<p>The story resonated with me deeply. I had lived for years in Inner Mongolia and made many Mongolian friends. And now this story unfolded in Sweden, where I too had come to live. The familiarity in the setting and the struggle made me stop and pay closer attention.</p>
<p>The article avoided drama. There were no sensational phrases or righteous outbursts. The space between paragraphs left room for the reader to imagine what couldn’t be written: the surveillance of family members, fractured homes, the weight of pressure crossing borders. The language was restrained, the facts clear, the narrative warm but never sentimental.</p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted to know who had published it. When I scrolled back to the masthead, I was startled. It was <em>The Epoch Times</em>.</p>
<p>A name so familiar, it had nearly slipped from my consciousness. Or perhaps, I had chosen to ignore it. My impression of <em>The Epoch Times</em> was that of a loud relative—constantly appearing in Chinese communities with cluttered pages, combative language, and articles obsessed with phrases like “quitting the CCP,” “heaven’s punishment,” or “telling the truth.” But this article had none of those terms. It was simply… a report about something that really happened.</p>
<p>That moment of dissonance was instant. Not because I doubted the facts of the story, but because I couldn’t reconcile <em>this kind</em> of reporting with <em>that kind</em> of outlet. How could something so quiet and credible come from a place I had dismissed for years?</p>
<p>I began to realize I had never truly understood <em>The Epoch Times</em>. I knew it was linked to Falun Gong, that it handed out free newspapers in Chinatowns, and that it often got lumped in with extremism, religion, and conspiracy theories. What I didn’t know was that somewhere along the way, it had learned how to tell stories like this.</p>
<p>But an even more important question arose:<br>Was this story being told by <em>them</em>—or was it something <em>I</em> wanted to hear?</p>
<p>When a publication starts to <strong>look like news</strong>, <strong>read like truth</strong>, and <strong>feel like neutrality</strong>, what should we trust—its content, or its power to leave us unquestioning?</p>
<p>Scrolling to the bottom of the article, I noticed a statement on the website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The Swedish edition of The Epoch Times maintains a neutral stance and holds no political affiliation.</em>“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounded exactly like the self-descriptions of mainstream news organizations. Even more convincing was the note that they are a member of the <strong>Swedish Media Publishers’ Association (TU)</strong>. That affiliation means they theoretically follow Sweden’s journalistic ethics and are subject to public scrutiny.</p>
<p>But institutional recognition doesn’t guarantee genuine transparency.</p>
<p>After reading several more reports—seemingly neutral, but with unmistakable ideological leanings—I couldn’t help but wonder:<br>Is this “impartiality” simply part of a larger linguistic strategy?</p>
<p>The truth is, <em>The Epoch Times</em> has never tried to hide its agenda. What it <em>has</em> mastered is hiding it in plain sight. It embeds its worldview not in editorials but in story selection. It wraps religious ideology in the language of human rights. It mimics the formats and tones of journalism while sidestepping its spirit of skepticism and rigorous methodology.</p>
<p>When “fitting the standards” becomes a disguise for narrative manipulation, how do we then discern fact from fiction?</p>
<p>So I began tracing its transformation.<br>How did a fringe religious publication evolve into a multilingual, cross-cultural, algorithm-savvy storytelling machine?<br>It looks like news—but perhaps it aspires to be something even more powerful.</p>
<p>This article began with that one glance.<br>And I haven’t stopped looking since.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="II-Origins-A-Dual-War-of-Faith-and-Narrative"><a href="#II-Origins-A-Dual-War-of-Faith-and-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="II. Origins | A Dual War of Faith and Narrative"></a>II. Origins | A Dual War of Faith and Narrative</h2><p>If <em>The Epoch Times</em> were just another news outlet, its existence might seem fragile—unnecessary, even.<br>But it was never just about the news.</p>
<p>Its roots lie not in journalism schools or liberal press traditions, but in a ruptured belief system—and the narrative war that followed. In 1999, the Chinese Communist Party officially banned <em>Falun Gong</em>. Before that, it had been a qigong-based spiritual movement combining elements of Buddhism and Daoism. After the ban, it was labeled a “heretical cult” by the state, and its followers were hunted, arrested, silenced.</p>
<p>From that moment on, practitioners began searching for a way to assert their existence outside the boundaries of state-sanctioned language.</p>
<p>They called it <em>“telling the truth”</em>—a phrase that became more than just a slogan. Within Falun Gong, <em>telling the truth</em> is a spiritual practice, a moral duty, even a path to personal salvation. It’s a deceptively simple linguistic act that carries a complex internal logic: not merely explaining one’s beliefs to outsiders, but reaffirming those beliefs to oneself. Speaking becomes an act of faith.</p>
<p>And media became the most powerful form of that faith in action.</p>
<p>In 2000, <em>The Epoch Times</em> was launched in the United States. Initially, it was a Chinese-language newspaper filled with denunciations of the Chinese Communist Party and testimonials of Falun Gong persecution. Its layout was messy, the tone urgent—anxious, almost, to leave a trace in history. But the publication quickly began to evolve, learning how to engage the outside world.</p>
<p>Unlike Chinese state media, which focused on sweeping nationalist narratives, <em>The Epoch Times</em> began with the stories of individual victims: persecution records, refugee interviews, trial photos, dark allegations of forced organ harvesting. It had no government backing, no diplomatic veneer—only a group of exiled believers and their unshakable conviction that the world <em>needed to know</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a product of journalistic professionalism.<br>It was the product of journalistic <em>will</em>.</p>
<p>For years, the paper was seen as a fringe publication—too extreme, too religious, too un-journalistic. But in the age of digital media, where mainstream outlets began collapsing under the weight of financial stress and eroding trust, <em>The Epoch Times</em> began to look increasingly… like the real thing.</p>
<p>It now boasts professional photographers and video editors. It knows how to craft algorithm-friendly clips and social media-ready headlines. It wraps extreme issues in neutral-sounding language. It mimics the sentence structures of Reuters and the BBC. At times, it even appears to respond faster than mainstream media during breaking news cycles.</p>
<p>But don’t be mistaken—this wasn’t a natural evolution.</p>
<p>It’s the result of a collision between religious logic and modern information technology. A belief system, forced to survive, has learned to speak in a language the world understands. <em>Telling the truth</em> is no longer just a spiritual duty—it has become a global strategy for narrative control.</p>
<p>So what is <em>The Epoch Times</em> now?<br>A religious outlet? A political machine?<br>Or something far more ambiguous—a new hybrid born of the information age’s gray zones?</p>
<p>That ambiguity, I believe, is its greatest strength—and its most elusive danger.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="III-Veins-and-Nervous-Systems-How-The-Epoch-Times-Operates-as-a-Full-Body-Narrative-Machine"><a href="#III-Veins-and-Nervous-Systems-How-The-Epoch-Times-Operates-as-a-Full-Body-Narrative-Machine" class="headerlink" title="III. Veins and Nervous Systems: How The Epoch Times Operates as a Full-Body Narrative Machine"></a>III. Veins and Nervous Systems: How <em>The Epoch Times</em> Operates as a Full-Body Narrative Machine</h2><p>If we were to use just one metaphor to describe <em>The Epoch Times</em> and the sprawling information ecosystem it belongs to, it wouldn’t be a newspaper. Nor a media company.<br>It would be a living, breathing organism—a narrative being, complete with capillaries, cultural membranes, and a central nervous system.</p>
<p>It has tiny vessels that reach into the streets and neighborhoods. It wraps its core ideology in soft cultural tissue. And at its center is a massive, highly coordinated newsroom that mimics the look and rhythm of professional journalism.</p>
<p>This organism is not state-funded, nor is it driven by market forces.<br>It runs on belief, conviction, organization, and technology.</p>
<h3 id="1-Capillary-Truth-The-Grassroots-Network-of-Message-Transmission"><a href="#1-Capillary-Truth-The-Grassroots-Network-of-Message-Transmission" class="headerlink" title="1. Capillary Truth: The Grassroots Network of Message Transmission"></a>1. Capillary Truth: The Grassroots Network of Message Transmission</h3><p>Long before “information warfare” became a buzzword, Falun Gong adherents had launched their own version of it—quietly, persistently, and locally.</p>
<p>In China, banknotes were deliberately printed with Falun Gong messages—“truth bills” that changed hands in daily transactions, each exchange becoming a point of ideological contact.</p>
<p>Overseas, in Chinatowns, metro stations, and parks, you’d find people handing out pamphlets, manning truth booths, collecting signatures.<br>Volunteers—often wearing yellow vests—approach you calmly, softly, telling you about forced organ harvesting and slipping you a brochure.<br>They do not seek to persuade.<br>They seek to be remembered.</p>
<p>These are not professional journalists. They are office workers, homemakers, retirees—ordinary immigrants with no salaries, only purpose. In their worldview, telling someone “the truth” is a form of spiritual salvation. They are the foot soldiers of a global discourse war: invisible, persistent, and present in nearly every city with a Chinese-speaking community.</p>
<p>This is a decentralized, belief-driven <strong>“information guerrilla network.”</strong><br>It’s not centralized like mainstream media, but it is resilient, platform-independent, and almost impossible to dismantle.</p>
<h3 id="2-Cultural-Muscle-Soft-Power-Through-Middle-Layer-Messaging"><a href="#2-Cultural-Muscle-Soft-Power-Through-Middle-Layer-Messaging" class="headerlink" title="2. Cultural Muscle: Soft Power Through Middle-Layer Messaging"></a>2. Cultural Muscle: Soft Power Through Middle-Layer Messaging</h3><p>The narrative machine doesn’t only exist on street corners or online—it also knows how to use <em>culture</em> to replace propaganda.</p>
<p>At the center of this cultural operation is <strong>Shen Yun</strong>, the performance troupe that transforms Falun Gong’s worldview into dance and music. The result: a visually stunning show that packages spiritual ideology as “traditional Chinese aesthetics.”</p>
<p>NTD Television (New Tang Dynasty TV) furthers this project through calligraphy contests, Chinese singing competitions, Hanfu fashion events, and youth speech contests—all under the banner of “traditional Chinese virtues.” These cultural activities seep into conservative communities and second-generation Chinese youth, especially in the West.</p>
<p>In some municipalities or cultural institutions, these events are presented as “non-political” and “non-religious,” occasionally gaining access to public funding or venues.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>“muscle layer”</strong> of the system—strong, flexible, and skillfully disguised. It wraps belief in culture. It doesn’t shout the truth; it lets cultural memory do the work.</p>
<h3 id="3-A-Central-Nervous-System-of-News-Mimicking-Professional-Journalism"><a href="#3-A-Central-Nervous-System-of-News-Mimicking-Professional-Journalism" class="headerlink" title="3. A Central Nervous System of News: Mimicking Professional Journalism"></a>3. A Central Nervous System of News: Mimicking Professional Journalism</h3><p>But perhaps the most fascinating—and dangerous—part lies at the top: <em>The Epoch Times’</em> professionalized news operation.</p>
<p>If you only looked at the Swedish or German editions, you might forget it has any religious roots at all. The websites are cleanly designed, with well-organized sections, author bylines, and daily publishing rhythms. The writing is measured and fact-based. Sources include Swedish public broadcasters, government data, and reports from established Western media.</p>
<p>But this newsroom doesn’t merely <em>resemble</em> professional media.<br>It is a <strong>sophisticated mimicry</strong> system.</p>
<p>From layout to syntax, from image curation to social media tone, everything is calibrated to make you <em>lower your guard</em>.</p>
<p>Its editorial strategy is highly targeted: It selects controversial local issues—immigration, crime, COVID-19, freedom of speech—and frames them with a skeptical tone that feels neither fully left nor fully right.</p>
<p>Some reporters are volunteer practitioners, but many are now paid freelancers or professionals recruited from smaller outlets. While there is no confirmed evidence of acquisitions of mainstream media, the linguistic polish and staffing levels clearly show that <em>The Epoch Times</em> is no longer an underground newspaper.</p>
<p>It <em>looks</em> like news.<br>It <em>functions</em> like news.<br>And for most readers, the difference between <em>news</em> and <em>something that looks like news</em> barely exists.</p>
<h3 id="4-Funding-Distribution-and-Expansion-What-Keeps-the-System-Running"><a href="#4-Funding-Distribution-and-Expansion-What-Keeps-the-System-Running" class="headerlink" title="4. Funding, Distribution, and Expansion: What Keeps the System Running?"></a>4. Funding, Distribution, and Expansion: What Keeps the System Running?</h3><p>So how does such a vast, multi-layered operation sustain itself?</p>
<p>The answer is belief and organization—not ad clicks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donations</strong> come from Falun Gong adherents worldwide, who see the media not just as something to support, but as an extension of their spiritual practice.</li>
<li><strong>Shen Yun performances</strong> are a financial engine. With high ticket prices and strong mobilization, proceeds often flow back into the media operation.</li>
<li><strong>Social media operations</strong> are expertly optimized. In the early days, <em>The Epoch Times</em> spent heavily on pro-Trump ads on Facebook, winning massive algorithmic reach in the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Editorial choices</strong> are belief-driven, not audience-driven. Unlike conventional outlets, they don’t rely on market demand to determine their coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, this is a <strong>“narrative perpetual motion machine”</strong>:<br>Belief produces content.<br>Content builds influence.<br>Influence attracts resources.<br>Resources strengthen the belief community and expand its capacity.</p>
<h3 id="5-An-Empire-Without-a-Map"><a href="#5-An-Empire-Without-a-Map" class="headerlink" title="5. An Empire Without a Map"></a>5. An Empire Without a Map</h3><p>From a single “truth bill” to a Shen Yun performance to a seemingly neutral local news report, <em>The Epoch Times</em> has built more than just a media network—it has built a <strong>global narrative infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<p>Its stories have no national borders, but its worldview has a core.<br>Its language no longer chants “Truth, Compassion, Forbearance” aloud—<br>Instead, it nudges <em>you</em> to say those words yourself.</p>
<p>And each story doesn’t ask you to <em>believe</em>.<br>It simply waits for the moment you do.</p>
<p>Maybe that moment comes just because—<br>it looks like news.</p>

<h2 id="IV-The-Cultural-Mask-From-Shen-Yun-to-the-Reinvention-of-the-Chinese-Narrative"><a href="#IV-The-Cultural-Mask-From-Shen-Yun-to-the-Reinvention-of-the-Chinese-Narrative" class="headerlink" title="IV. The Cultural Mask: From Shen Yun to the Reinvention of the Chinese Narrative"></a>IV. The Cultural Mask: From Shen Yun to the Reinvention of the Chinese Narrative</h2><p>Some narratives are not meant to convince you—they’re meant to move you.</p>
<p>Within the <em>Epoch Times</em> media ecosystem, the most persuasive and least scrutinized content isn’t the news. It’s the culture.<br>From colorful stages to retellings of ancient legends, from guzheng-accompanied dances to “reviving traditional virtues” competitions, a new kind of aestheticized cultural narrative is taking shape—wrapped in beauty, nostalgia, and the language of heritage.</p>
<p>This is what we might call the <strong>cultural mask</strong> of <em>The Epoch Times</em>:<br>It doesn’t preach. It doesn’t shout.<br>It simply performs something you think you already know.</p>
<h3 id="1-Shen-Yun-Aesthetic-Translation-of-a-Religious-Worldview"><a href="#1-Shen-Yun-Aesthetic-Translation-of-a-Religious-Worldview" class="headerlink" title="1. Shen Yun: Aesthetic Translation of a Religious Worldview"></a>1. Shen Yun: Aesthetic Translation of a Religious Worldview</h3><p>At the center of this cultural project stands <strong>Shen Yun Performing Arts</strong>.<br>It presents itself as a revival of “5,000 years of divine Chinese culture.” In truth, it is a performing group composed entirely of Falun Gong practitioners, deeply infused with the movement’s core religious teachings.</p>
<p>Interwoven between dazzling dance numbers are narratives of faith under communist persecution, stories of moral decline leading to destruction, and dramatizations of universal karmic justice. These themes are packaged within high-level choreography, advanced stage technology, and ornate visual design—offering audiences an emotional experience that blends cultural nostalgia with spiritual elevation.</p>
<p>Audiences often don’t realize that each act carries symbolic meaning rooted in Falun Gong’s cosmology.<br>But that doesn’t prevent resonance.<br>The power of culture is that it doesn’t require full understanding to be felt.</p>
<p>Shen Yun tickets are expensive. The troupe performs in some of the most prestigious theaters around the world. Its branding is remarkably consistent, with global tours backed by aggressive social media marketing, direct mail campaigns, and word-of-mouth promotion.<br>Every performance becomes a meticulously packaged act of spiritual storytelling.</p>
<h3 id="2-Traditional-Virtues-Not-Propaganda-The-“China-You-Remember”"><a href="#2-Traditional-Virtues-Not-Propaganda-The-“China-You-Remember”" class="headerlink" title="2. Traditional Virtues, Not Propaganda: The “China You Remember”"></a>2. Traditional Virtues, Not Propaganda: The “China You Remember”</h3><p>Beyond Shen Yun, <em>The Epoch Times</em> and its affiliate platforms continuously produce cultural programming with traditional Chinese themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NTD Television</strong> hosts global Chinese martial arts tournaments, calligraphy contests, and classical dance competitions.</li>
<li><em>The Epoch Times</em> publishes features on Chinese wisdom, traditional health practices, and reimagined moral parables.</li>
<li>Locally, they organize Hanfu festivals, food heritage forums, and essay contests about filial piety.</li>
</ul>
<p>These cultural products use neutral language, traditional aesthetics, and conservative forms. In the multicultural contexts of Europe and North America, they are often welcomed as harmless—or even laudable—expressions of ethnic heritage.</p>
<p>But embedded within these seemingly apolitical cultural events is a <strong>religious logic</strong> and <strong>spiritualized aesthetic</strong>.<br>So-called “traditional culture” is framed as divine order recovered from historical amnesia.<br>So-called “Chinese spirit” is defined by a worldview that rejects communism, modernity, and secularism.</p>
<p>This is not nostalgia.<br>This is <strong>cultural reclamation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="3-Narrative-Rewriting-Who-Gets-to-Define-“China”"><a href="#3-Narrative-Rewriting-Who-Gets-to-Define-“China”" class="headerlink" title="3. Narrative Rewriting: Who Gets to Define “China”?"></a>3. Narrative Rewriting: Who Gets to Define “China”?</h3><p>What <em>The Epoch Times</em> and its affiliates are doing is not merely journalism or cultural revival—it is a <strong>semantic war over the meaning of China</strong>.</p>
<p>In this battle for symbolic authority, the Chinese Communist Party claims to represent modern China: economic power, global governance, national unity.<br>Falun Gong and its media counter this with a vision of <strong>a China without the CCP</strong>—<br>A “true” China that is divine, moral, and governed by karmic justice.</p>
<p>To reconstruct China’s meaning is to reconstruct its memory and narrative.</p>
<p>This battle plays out not on the level of ideology alone, but in the everyday: in aesthetic choices, cultural tastes, educational framing, and linguistic cues.<br>It doesn’t confront you like propaganda.<br>It surrounds you like climate—slow, ambient, and persuasive.</p>
<p>Eventually, you may find yourself believing that the dancers in silk robes, the stories of filial piety, the classical drama—that <em>this</em> is the true face of China.</p>
<h3 id="4-When-Aesthetics-Become-a-Disguise-for-Belief"><a href="#4-When-Aesthetics-Become-a-Disguise-for-Belief" class="headerlink" title="4. When Aesthetics Become a Disguise for Belief"></a>4. When Aesthetics Become a Disguise for Belief</h3><p>The most difficult narratives to critique are the beautiful ones.</p>
<p>Shen Yun dazzles with polished choreography, radiant color palettes, and cutting-edge digital backdrops. What it offers is not just a performance—it’s a <em>feel-good</em>, socially shareable, algorithm-friendly <em>experience of cultural positivity</em>.</p>
<p>And this strategy works.</p>
<p>The more you admire its artistry and care, the less likely you are to question its deeper motivations. It’s no longer religious proselytism.<br>It’s <strong>emotional politics blended with aesthetic performance</strong>.<br>It doesn’t demand conversion—it simply asks for empathy.<br>And once that emotional bond is established, you’re more likely to trust <em>The Epoch Times</em>, NTD programs, or even their cultural blogs.</p>
<p>You might think, “They seem trustworthy.”<br>After all, most of what they report <em>is</em> true.</p>
<h3 id="5-This-Isn’t-Soft-Power—It’s-a-War-of-Belief-Told-in-Culture"><a href="#5-This-Isn’t-Soft-Power—It’s-a-War-of-Belief-Told-in-Culture" class="headerlink" title="5. This Isn’t Soft Power—It’s a War of Belief, Told in Culture"></a>5. This Isn’t Soft Power—It’s a War of Belief, Told in Culture</h3><p>In modern political theory, culture is often described as a source of soft power.<br>But the <em>Epoch Times</em> ecosystem has gone further.<br>Its cultural engineering is not about branding.<br>It is an <strong>extension of spiritual narrative control</strong>.</p>
<p>It seeks to shape your understanding of China through form and feeling.<br>It seeks to implant a cosmology you did not ask for.<br>It doesn’t force belief—but it does invite doubt about everything else.</p>
<p>And its real strength lies not in logic, but in <em>sensation</em>.<br>Through culture, it translates faith into something moving—something touching.</p>
<p>This is a war without gunfire.<br>But it is full of applause.</p>
<p>It does not try to persuade you.<br>It simply makes you want to cry.</p>

<h2 id="V-Why-They’re-More-Effective"><a href="#V-Why-They’re-More-Effective" class="headerlink" title="V. Why They’re More Effective?"></a>V. Why They’re More Effective?</h2><p><em>A Narrative Contrast Between The Epoch Times and China’s Official Propaganda</em></p>
<p>When it comes to “telling the truth,” <em>The Epoch Times</em> and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are like mirrored reflections of each other. Both claim narrative authority. Both operate transnational media empires. Both rely on a tightly woven political-belief system.</p>
<p>But there is one crucial difference:<br>The CCP wants you to know it’s official.<br><em>The Epoch Times</em> wants you to forget where it came from.</p>
<p>And that may be precisely why it’s more effective.</p>
<h3 id="1-Narrative-Technique-One-Shouts-the-Other-Tells-Stories"><a href="#1-Narrative-Technique-One-Shouts-the-Other-Tells-Stories" class="headerlink" title="1. Narrative Technique: One Shouts, the Other Tells Stories"></a>1. Narrative Technique: One Shouts, the Other Tells Stories</h3><p>China’s official propaganda arms—like <em>China Daily</em>, <em>Xinhua News Agency</em>, and <em>CGTN</em>—are known for grand narratives and bureaucratic language. They excel at discussing policy, achievements, and international order, but rarely focus on people, rarely show doubt, and almost never expose cracks.</p>
<p><em>The Epoch Times</em>, by contrast, tells stories.<br>A refugee’s escape.<br>A broken family under surveillance.<br>A believer’s painful choice.</p>
<p>These are intimate, emotionally-driven narratives grounded in concrete detail, often told using Western journalistic formats.<br>Where the CCP says, <em>“This is who we are,”</em> <em>The Epoch Times</em> implies, <em>“You could be one of us.”</em></p>
<p>One appeals to collective identity and ideological framing.<br>The other invites personal empathy and shared vulnerability.<br>The difference is dramatic: one reads like a textbook. The other, like a film.<br>One informs. The other moves.</p>

Media Posture: One Represents the State, the Other Disguises as the People</h3><p>The biggest problem with Chinese official media isn’t necessarily what it says—but how easily it’s recognized.</p>
<p>No matter how closely it mimics Western media formats, it’s still labeled “Chinese state media.” That label alone raises red flags and cognitive walls for global audiences.</p>
<p><em>The Epoch Times</em> is different. It never claims to represent anyone.<br>It presents itself as an independent, nonprofit media outlet committed to truth.<br>It hides its religious roots behind its stories, buries political positions in cultural packaging, and emerges as a “plausible alternative” rather than a clearly defined voice.</p>
<p>Its success lies in its <strong>subtle ubiquity</strong>.<br>Not loud, but everywhere.</p>

Diffusion Strategy: One Relies on Control, the Other on Algorithms</h3><p>The CCP’s global propaganda depends on state-sponsored media channels, diplomatic networks, academic partnerships, and government outreach. But in democratic societies, these strategies often meet with resistance or suspicion. Entry into the mainstream is slow, and access is tightly monitored.</p>
<p><em>The Epoch Times</em>, meanwhile, thrives in digital ecosystems.</p>
<ul>
<li>It operates vast multi-language networks on platforms like Facebook and YouTube.</li>
<li>It produces emotionally attuned video clips and articles tailored to “political skeptics,” “anxious middle-class readers,” and “anti-leftist youth.”</li>
<li>It inserts its narratives into local controversies—immigration, vaccines, education, crime—while wrapping its belief system in news formatting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the CCP is <strong>loud and centralized</strong>, <em>The Epoch Times</em> is <strong>fluid and dispersed</strong>.<br>One is a megaphone.<br>The other is background music—less likely to provoke, more likely to be absorbed.</p>

Constructing Legitimacy: One Creates Distance, the Other Builds Closeness</h3><p>The language of Chinese propaganda often clashes with Western norms. Its value systems, vocabulary, and rhetoric feel alien, authoritarian, or antiquated.</p>
<p>But <em>The Epoch Times</em> doesn’t just mimic Western journalistic syntax.<br>Its values—freedom, anti-authoritarianism, conservative morality, spiritual conviction—<strong>align surprisingly well</strong> with many of the West’s deepest anxieties.</p>
<p>It constructs emotional bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>They are also victims.</em></li>
<li><em>They are also dissidents.</em></li>
<li><em>They might not be so different from us.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This generates <strong>soft legitimacy</strong>—not through diplomacy, but through quiet, consistent presence:<br>A heartfelt article.<br>An elegant cultural show.<br>A shareable video in your feed.</p>

Conclusion: Who’s Telling the Truth—and Who’s Redefining It?</h3><p>In this narrative war, <em>The Epoch Times</em> may appear smaller, with fewer resources. But its strategies—covert infiltration, layered messaging, emotional storytelling, and journalistic mimicry—are <strong>harder to detect, harder to resist, and harder to discredit</strong>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need you to adopt its version of truth.<br>It only needs you to doubt everyone else’s.</p>
<p>And in an age of information overload, the power to provoke doubt can be more dangerous—and more persuasive—than the power to convince.</p>
<p>That is why <em>The Epoch Times</em> might be more successful than China’s official propaganda.</p>
<p>Not because it is more truthful—<br>but because it doesn’t look like propaganda.<br>It just looks like news.</p>

<p>News has never been just about delivering information—<br>It’s about constructing <strong>trust</strong>.</p>
<p>And the success of <em>The Epoch Times</em> doesn’t lie in offering the truth, but in redefining what kind of language <em>looks like</em> the truth.</p>
<p>It hasn’t rewritten the rules of the world.<br>It has rewritten your perception of <em>what feels credible</em>.<br>This is a reconstruction of both <strong>linguistic technique</strong> and <strong>narrative form</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why its reporting now mirrors mainstream journalism:<br>Restrained headlines. Clean layout. Neutral tone. Proper image captions.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of “Evil Spirit Eliminates the CCP” or “Falun Dafa Is Good.”<br>Instead, the tone has shifted to quiet skepticism—<br>questioning vaccine policies,<br>raising concerns about Chinese tech infiltration,<br>highlighting media silence on immigration-related crime.</p>
<p>This tone doesn’t demand agreement.<br>It simply makes you wonder: <em>What if the mainstream is hiding something?</em></p>
<p>And that seed of uncertainty—<br>is the space where it enters.</p>

Simulating Truth: The Rearrangement of Language and Structure</h3><p>The narrative strategy of <em>The Epoch Times</em> isn’t built on lies.<br>It’s built on a sense of <em>truthiness</em>—a term from psychology and media studies that refers to information that <strong>feels true</strong>, even when unverifiable.</p>
<p>The method is simple, and incredibly effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use real facts as raw material (e.g., refugee harassment, election disputes, pandemic confusion)</li>
<li>Embed subtle ideological cues (e.g., “CCP ties,” “mainstream suppression”)</li>
<li>Wrap it in familiar journalistic language and visual templates</li>
<li>Repeat, distribute, cross-post across platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t invent a new truth.<br>It simply rearranges the paragraphs, shifts the subject of the sentence.<br>And once the syntax changes, your <strong>perception</strong> does too.</p>

<p><em>The Epoch Times</em> thrives in this void.</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses <strong>anti-globalist language</strong> to attract conservatives</li>
<li><strong>Human rights rhetoric</strong> to win over liberals</li>
<li><strong>Traditional culture</strong> to resonate with Chinese diasporas</li>
<li><strong>Questioning tone</strong> to seem palatable to the undecided</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t ask you to believe it immediately.<br>It only needs you to <strong>believe others a little less</strong>.</p>

<li>On race, for fear of being accused of discrimination</li>
<li>On China, due to diplomatic and economic caution</li>
<li>On religion, to avoid clashes of values</li>
</ul>
<p>These silence zones are where <em>The Epoch Times</em> and its affiliates move in—<br>quickly, strategically.</p>
<p>It speaks the suppressed emotion.<br>It builds narrative presence in excluded language.<br>And it earns <strong>moral capital</strong> for doing so.</p>
<p>In the modern world, just <em>daring to speak</em> becomes a currency of legitimacy.<br>And when “speaking out” is confused with “telling the truth,”<br>narrative power begins to take root—not because it’s the most accurate,<br>but because it’s the <strong>first, the loudest, and the most persistent</strong>.</p>

<p>It seizes ownership of the word <em>truth</em>.<br>Once that happens, any alternative narrative becomes a form of <em>concealment</em>.</p>
<p>It builds a language system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubting the mainstream is rational</li>
<li>Believing <em>them</em> means you’re awake</li>
<li>Dismissing them means you’ve been brainwashed</li>
</ul>
<p>And once that language begins to shape your information environment,<br>you don’t have to convert to their belief system.<br>You simply begin to <strong>lose your ability to recognize</strong> other options.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate form of narrative dominance:<br>Not persuading you,<br>but making you <strong>unable to speak your doubts</strong>.</p>

<p>We don’t believe false narratives because we’re foolish, but because they <strong>look and sound</strong> like something familiar. They wear the clothes of journalism, mimic the tone of freedom, and prey on our existing unease with mainstream discourse. They appear trustworthy. They sound reasonable. And eventually, they feel like they might be… true.</p>
<p>This is the true danger of <em>The Epoch Times</em> and its narrative machine:<br>It doesn’t ask you to switch sides—<br>It just makes you question what you used to trust.</p>

<p>Some of the content may be true. Some may be distorted.<br>But all of it shares a common rhetorical logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mainstream has an agenda. Stay vigilant.</li>
<li>Governments and the left are hiding the truth.</li>
<li>Traditional values, faith, and family are salvation.</li>
<li>Questions are more effective than answers:<br><em>“Have you noticed disasters are becoming more frequent?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These cues construct a <strong>parallel linguistic universe</strong>—<br>One where you <em>think</em> you’re still thinking,<br>but your thoughts have already been rerouted by someone else’s frame.</p>

<ul>
<li>Guide you to “discover” the truth, rather than preach it</li>
<li>Infiltrate the mainstream like a virus, implanting doubt instead of shouting ideology</li>
<li>Package religious belief in the language of neutrality</li>
<li>Push positions gently through phrases like <em>“Think for yourself”</em> or <em>“Just ask the question”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of messaging doesn’t tell you what to believe—<br>It teaches you what <strong>not</strong> to trust.<br>And when all traditional trust systems are dismantled,<br><em>it becomes the last voice still speaking.</em></p>

<p>You may no longer trust public health agencies—<br>but you’ll share a health video from <em>Epoch Health</em>.<br>You might be wary of <em>The Epoch Times</em>—<br>but a refugee story touches you deeply,<br>and you think, <em>“At least this part is true.”</em></p>
<p>These <strong>fragments of trust</strong>, accumulated piece by piece,<br>create a world where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t trust systems—only isolated impressions</li>
<li>We don’t seek evidence—only stories that feel right</li>
<li>We don’t verify—we just go with what’s emotionally comfortable</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Epoch Times</em> doesn’t tear down the system.<br>It simply offers a version of the world where <strong>doubt feels good</strong>.</p>

Consequence II: A Fractured Language in Democratic Societies</h4><p>Public language is the operating system of democracy.<br>Even in disagreement, we rely on shared rules, concepts, and terms.</p>
<p>The success of <em>The Epoch Times</em> lies in its ability to <strong>enter this space</strong>—<br>to look like journalism without assuming its responsibilities.<br>It doesn’t verify. It doesn’t accept challenge.<br>It seeks <strong>influence without accountability</strong>.</p>
<p>Over time, this creates <strong>two parallel narrative systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One based on institutions, evidence, and incremental progress</li>
<li>One based on emotion, belief, and binary opposition</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the second becomes dominant,<br>we’re no longer in a democracy.<br>We’re in a battleground of narrative fragments.</p>

<p>It used familiar rhythm, centered on a topic I cared about, and maintained a humane, neutral tone. I read it without suspicion. I even considered sharing it.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem:<br>That story wasn’t from a neutral outlet.<br>It was the frontend of a <strong>narrative machine</strong>.<br>A polished product of ideological engineering.</p>
<p>I don’t doubt the facts of the story.<br>But I have to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If facts are being used as tools,<br>how much of what we believe is really <em>our</em> judgment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think we’re reading the news.<br>Maybe we’re just being convinced by what <em>looks</em> like news.</p>
<p>We think we’re chasing truth.<br>Maybe we’ve only been walking toward what <strong>feels</strong> like it.</p>

If the Report Is True, Is It Still Propaganda?"></a>VII-2. If the Report Is True, Is It Still Propaganda?</h3><p>I’ve re-read many reports from the Swedish edition of <em>The Epoch Times</em>.<br>Some are well-researched, emotionally restrained, and quote sources accurately.<br>I’ve caught myself wondering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If this had come from <em>The Guardian</em> or <em>Dagens Nyheter</em>, I wouldn’t hesitate to share it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s the haunting question:<br><strong>If the report is factual, is it still propaganda?</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t just my question—<br>It cuts to the heart of <strong>information ethics in the digital age</strong>.</p>
<p>Propaganda has evolved.<br>It no longer depends on lies.<br>It depends on <strong>our trust in the format</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>The Epoch Times</em> demonstrates factual accuracy.<br>It sometimes covers China’s human rights violations more swiftly than mainstream media.<br>It gives voice to truths others shy away from due to self-censorship.</p>
<p>But the real question is:<br><strong>How are these truths chosen, framed, and sequenced?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why this refugee and not another?</li>
<li>Why Xinjiang, but rarely other persecuted faiths?</li>
<li>Why pair a migrant victim with crime statistics?</li>
</ul>
<p>We see a series of real reports—<br>What we don’t see is the <strong>invisible hand controlling the spotlight</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s where propaganda is born:<br>Not from lies, but from <strong>selective truths</strong>.</p>
<p>This is more sophisticated than deception.<br>You can’t disprove the facts,<br>but you still can’t call it neutral.</p>
<p>This is <strong>narrative design at its most powerful</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use truth to earn narrative trust</li>
<li>Use narrative to shift ideological gravity</li>
<li>Use format to obscure origins</li>
<li>Use local language to blur belief systems</li>
</ul>
<p>And once you trust the content,<br>you start to accept the perspective—<br>even the unspoken worldview behind it.</p>
<p>That’s not a journalistic triumph.<br>That’s a narrative victory.</p>

<p>Traditional propaganda is crude, emotional, obvious.<br>You know where it stands.</p>
<p>But this?<br>This is well-formatted, neutrally toned, locally relevant.<br>It <strong>violates no thresholds</strong>.<br>It feels just like what you already trust.</p>
<p>Even as a media professional,<br>I find it eerily familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li>The layout resembles BBC</li>
<li>The tone sounds like <em>Dagens Nyheter</em></li>
<li>The photo editing mirrors SVT</li>
<li>The topic choices match what liberal newspapers would cover</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I even think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Maybe they’ve changed. Maybe they <em>do</em> want to do real journalism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s the brilliance of it.<br>They don’t change their <strong>faith</strong>—just their <strong>tone</strong>.<br>They don’t abandon ideology—just repackage it.</p>
<p><em>Falun Gong</em> never abandoned its cosmological narrative.<br>It merely pushed it deeper—into Shen Yun, into health shows, into lifestyle blogs.</p>
<p>You won’t find “reincarnation” or “Dafa” on the front page anymore.<br>Instead, you’ll find stories built on a <em>new moral code</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good vs. Evil</li>
<li>Communism as the root of all decline</li>
<li>Western moral decay and the hope of redemption</li>
<li>Cosmic justice, eventually</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t religious proselytizing.<br>This is <strong>a narrative worldview that speaks through news</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to believe in Falun Gong—<br>You’re already interpreting the world in its story structure.</p>
<p>And that—<br>That is the real power.</p>

Conclusion: Who Speaks, Who Defines Truth?</h2><p>We’ve grown used to trusting the surface of journalism—<br>If the tone is calm, the layout clean, the sources listed, we assume it’s credible.</p>
<p>This instinct comes from a long history of media literacy built in democratic societies, and from the ethical standards that professional journalism once worked hard to uphold.</p>
<p>But what happens when a media organization <strong>follows those standards in appearance</strong>, yet intends to tell an entirely different story?<br>What happens when 70–80% of its reporting is accurate—enough to convince us of the 20–30% that isn’t?</p>
<p>That is the real strategy—<br>and the real danger—<br>of <em>The Epoch Times</em>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t challenge our understanding.<br>It <strong>mimics</strong> it.<br>It doesn’t break journalistic norms.<br>It <strong>reproduces</strong> their outer shell.<br>It doesn’t confront democracy directly.<br>It quietly <strong>infiltrates</strong> and <strong>occupies</strong> the trust structures that democracy has built into journalism.</p>
<p>It <strong>looks</strong> like news.<br>It <strong>sounds</strong> like news.<br>Its design and headlines resemble real journalism.<br>It localizes with uncanny precision—knowing which topics resonate, which emotional cues strike home, which social tensions are ripe for “exposure.”</p>
<p>And once that mimicry is embedded deeply enough, its underlying belief system, value judgments, and narrative goals no longer need to be declared.<br>They become part of what we unconsciously accept as “what news looks like.”</p>
<p>This <strong>aesthetic fusion</strong> conceals <strong>ideological divergence</strong>.<br>Localization isn’t about understanding—it’s about packaging.<br>Familiar language rhythms don’t invite critical thinking—they disarm it.</p>
<p>And we, the readers, living amid an era of information overload and media trust collapse, must begin asking not just:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What does this article say?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who is it speaking for? Why does it exist? And where did its tone come from?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because in this age where <strong>everything looks like news</strong>,<br><strong>who gets to speak</strong> will define what we call “truth.”<br><strong>Who controls the format</strong> will determine what seems “credible.”</p>
<p>The most dangerous lies are not the loud ones.<br>They are the ones that <strong>look perfectly normal</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Truth ≠ Neutrality</strong>: A media outlet can report facts and still not serve the truth.</li>
<li><strong>Format ≠ Ethics</strong>: The shape of journalism can be learned. Its spirit cannot be so easily cloned.</li>
<li><strong>Familiarity ≠ Trust</strong>: The more comfortable something feels, the more alert we should be.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can no longer evaluate media <strong>just</strong> by the truth of its content.<br>We must also ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How was this “truth” arranged?<br>Who does it serve?<br>Who does it silence?</p>
