<h2 id="I-Introduction-The-Classroom-Lights-Before-Dawn"><a href="#I-Introduction-The-Classroom-Lights-Before-Dawn" class="headerlink" title="I. Introduction: The Classroom Lights Before Dawn"></a>I. Introduction: The Classroom Lights Before Dawn</h2><p>At 5:45 a.m., a small northern Chinese town lies silent under the mist. The only light comes from the flickering windows of a school building. Outside the gate, groups of small-framed students stand in the cold, their breath visible in the air, waiting for the teacher on duty to unlock the doors. A cup of soy milk remains half-drunk, a reference book already open. For these children—just fourteen or fifteen years old—their day begins now and won’t end until nearly eleven at night.</p>
<p>This is not a boot camp, nor the final weeks before college entrance exams. It’s the daily schedule practiced in many Chinese secondary schools, commonly known as the “611 education system.” Under this regime, students are required to arrive before 6 a.m. and leave no earlier than 11 p.m., six or even seven days a week, totaling over 100 study hours per week. Some schools explicitly forbid napping and mandate additional “dormitory self-study” after 10 p.m., until lights-out at 11.</p>
<p>Student life is compressed into a few repeating fragments: classroom, cafeteria, bathroom, and back to the classroom. On average, they sleep less than six hours a night. They are utterly exhausted but forbidden to show it. Teachers punish perceived laziness harshly, and parents accept this as the “necessary suffering” that leads to future success. This system resembles a micro-militarized regime or a teenage version of a labor camp—except here, what’s being consumed isn’t labor, but youth, health, freedom, and hope.</p>
<p>When asked why the effort is necessary, the answer is often, <em>“If you don’t study hard now, what will happen in the future?”</em> So these children write essays titled <em>“My Dream”</em> in the quiet hours of the night, never having truly dreamed—because the time for dreams has already been stolen.</p>
<p>The “611 education system” is not merely an administrative method; it is a socially sanctioned structure of violence. Under its shadow, students are forced to erase individuality, suppress emotion, and obey mechanical discipline, constantly operating under chronic stress and hyper-competition. Yet in official educational reports, all of this is reduced to one thing: ever-improving metrics of exam success.</p>
<p>But is this education system truly justifiable? When children lose their right to rest, to play, to be with family, and to experience joy—left only with report cards and behavioral evaluations—have we not already crossed the moral boundary of what education should be?</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a growing number of voices are questioning whether the “611 education system” constitutes a violation of basic child rights. Does it breach the <em>Law on the Protection of Minors</em> or the <em>UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</em>, which explicitly guarantee rest, health, and the freedom of development? And perhaps more troubling: have we all silently become accomplices in this machinery of educational oppression?</p>
<p>This article begins with the students’ lived experiences, tracing the spread of the “611” system, exposing the structural and economic pressures behind it, and re-examining its implications through the lens of international human rights. For a generation of children deprived of dreams—what is education truly offering them?</p>
<h2 id="II-Systemic-Expansion-From-Hengshui-to-the-Nation"><a href="#II-Systemic-Expansion-From-Hengshui-to-the-Nation" class="headerlink" title="II. Systemic Expansion: From Hengshui to the Nation"></a>II. Systemic Expansion: From Hengshui to the Nation</h2><p>On the campus of Hengshui High School, a well-known slogan reads: <em>“Sweat more today, shed fewer tears tomorrow.”</em> It hangs between the cafeteria and classroom buildings, reminding every student that hard work is not an option but a war to be fought with everything they’ve got. The success of the Hengshui model lies not in creating more choices—but in effectively eliminating them.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the shadow of Hengshui has stretched across the nation. From Shandong, Henan, and Anhui to Sichuan and Hunan, countless schools have adopted its model: standardized schedules, military-style discipline, 24&#x2F;7 surveillance. Even uniforms, morning recitations, and synchronized physical drills are copied with astonishing precision. Teachers are expected to devote their entire lives to teaching; students are encouraged to “endure temporary suffering to earn lifelong sweetness.” Parents, meanwhile, silently comply, surrendering their children to the system, to the school, to the numbers.</p>
<p>In early 2025, a whistleblower platform called “611 ICU” quietly launched. Created by concerned educators and civil society members, it received an overwhelming flood of anonymous submissions within weeks. A student from Fujian sent a handwritten schedule detailing his daily routine: waking at 5:20 a.m., returning to the dorm at 11 p.m., with four tests per day. A parent from Hunan reported that their child’s school banned going home on weekends—doing so would lead to moral grade deductions. Students from Inner Mongolia and Gansu shared that they get only five hours of sleep per night and suffer from chronic headaches, nausea, and memory loss.</p>
<p>By mid-February, more than 2,200 secondary schools had been reported as practicing the “611 education system,” including prestigious city-level schools and elite private institutions. This is not a case of a few outliers—it’s a systemic sacrifice to the gods of exam scores.</p>
<p>For many parents, this is a battle that cannot be lost. Faced with a brutal job market, rigid social hierarchies, and a disappearing middle class, they place all their hopes on their children. Thus, children become vessels of compensation, carrying life scripts forged from their parents’ own unfulfilled dreams. One mother from Anhui wrote to the platform: <em>“I know this is wrong, but if we don’t do it, I’m afraid he won’t even get into a basic university.”</em> Her words reveal both resistance and helplessness.</p>
<p>Systems do not expand through orders alone—they thrive on fear. Fear of failure. Fear of falling behind. Fear of being trampled in the brutal competition of the gaokao. The “611 education system” offers a seemingly logical solution: time becomes achievement, fatigue becomes effort, and pain is mistaken for a ticket to the future.</p>
<p>But are we willing to admit that this “future” is a mirage, bought at the cost of youth and dignity?</p>
<h2 id="III-The-Cost-to-Body-and-Mind-Silent-Breakdown-Under-Pressure"><a href="#III-The-Cost-to-Body-and-Mind-Silent-Breakdown-Under-Pressure" class="headerlink" title="III. The Cost to Body and Mind: Silent Breakdown Under Pressure"></a>III. The Cost to Body and Mind: Silent Breakdown Under Pressure</h2><p>In a widely circulated surveillance video, a high school girl suddenly breaks down crying in her classroom, attempting to storm out but is stopped and dragged back by a teacher on duty. She collapses to the floor, clutching her head, her wailing erupting from the depths of her chest. Her classmates do not approach; they keep their heads down, quietly reading—as if this kind of breakdown were just another routine part of school life.</p>
<p>The “611 system” is not just an overextension of time—it is a sustained depletion of students’ physical and psychological well-being. A senior high student in Sichuan wrote anonymously in his diary:<br><em>“Every morning, the first thing I do when I open my eyes is count how many days are left until the college entrance exam—as if I’m counting how much longer I can endure.”</em><br>He describes waking up in panic at night, dreaming of being late, failing exams, or being held back a grade. During the day, he suffers headaches, nausea, and memory lapses, but has no choice but to press on. In this system, weakness is shameful, a burden, a sign of failure.</p>
<p>According to an informal survey in China, over 30% of students under “intensive closed-off management” report long-term insomnia and anxiety. Nearly 40% say they “do not feel happiness or freedom at school.” In the shadows rarely illuminated by media coverage, cases of self-harm and suicide occasionally surface—only to be quickly dismissed by schools or authorities as “psychological issues” or “family problems,” leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>Students’ bodies have become instruments measuring the strain of the system. Premature skeletal development issues, deteriorating eyesight, disrupted menstrual cycles, extreme fatigue, and even adolescent hypertension and arrhythmia—conditions typically seen in adults—are now appearing earlier and more frequently. A middle school homeroom teacher in Shanghai privately shared that most of her students start taking sleeping pills or cognitive supplements as early as 8th grade. Parents, she added, “generally approve—or even initiate it—because everyone is doing it.”</p>
<p>In this environment, students gradually learn to suppress themselves. They fear that expressing emotion will earn them labels like “weak” or “not resilient enough,” so they remain silent. They start questioning themselves: <em>Am I not working hard enough? Do I deserve to fail? Am I just not good enough?</em> These unheard voices are worn down over countless mock exams and late-night study sessions—until even crying feels like a waste of time.</p>
<p>This is not merely an educational crisis—it is a profound human tragedy. When a society equates a child’s worth with test scores, glorifies exhaustion, and romanticizes suffering as a rite of passage, we must ask: Are we, perhaps unknowingly, complicit in a betrayal of our shared humanity?</p>
<p>In this quiet violence, what’s being taken is not only rest or childhood—but an entire generation’s inner freedom and psychological integrity. If education is still seen as the path to success, can it still be trusted to nurture complete and healthy souls?</p>
<h2 id="IV-The-Legal-Gap-When-Protection-Exists-Only-on-Paper"><a href="#IV-The-Legal-Gap-When-Protection-Exists-Only-on-Paper" class="headerlink" title="IV. The Legal Gap: When Protection Exists Only on Paper"></a>IV. The Legal Gap: When Protection Exists Only on Paper</h2><p>On paper, Chinese students are protected by a series of laws. Article 41 of the <em>Law on the Protection of Minors</em> clearly states:<br><em>“Schools and kindergartens shall ensure rest and activity time for minors and must not increase their academic burden.”</em><br>The <em>Education Law</em> also stresses that education should promote the overall development of the person, respecting both physical and mental health as well as individuality.</p>
<p>But to children buried in textbooks, these words read more like distant promises—beautiful, but powerless.</p>
<p>In the reality of the “611 system,” rest becomes a “luxury,” and activity time is labeled a “waste.” Lunch breaks are often used for exams or make-up classes; physical education is compressed or canceled altogether. Some schools even ban students from playing sports on the field, allowing only walking—lest they have too much fun. Students are no longer nurtured beings but tightly wound mechanical springs.</p>
<p>The gap between law and reality stems from both weak enforcement and warped values. When entrance exam scores become the primary performance metric for local governments, and when teachers’ evaluations are tied to student results, the entire system gravitates toward sacrificing student rights in exchange for short-term performance and institutional prestige. Laws become mere suggestions, not boundaries.</p>
<p>What’s more concerning is that some local education bureaus not only fail to curb excessive academic hours but actively endorse or promote them. The Hengshui model is exported as a “success story” to regional schools. Others skirt legal restrictions by rebranding extra classes, evening study, or weekend sessions as “voluntary,” though peer pressure, teacher hints, and parental expectations often strip away any true choice.</p>
<p>This is systemic disguise—a drain on human rights cloaked in the language of personal will. Students and parents, lacking viable channels for complaint or alternatives, are frequently left defenseless. Even when a report is filed, it usually fades into silence. Some students who speak up face surveillance, retaliation, or targeted disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>This systemic dysfunction exposes a deeper rift in China’s education between rule of law and human rights awareness. Laws are meant to protect the vulnerable and check power imbalances. But in reality, they often serve as passive posters on the wall—reminders of what we should have, and what we are most likely to lose.</p>
<p>When laws intended to protect minors fail to guarantee their sleep, rest, and health, and when high-intensity learning is normalized and legalized, what we face is not just an administrative failure—but a profound human rights crisis.</p>
<h2 id="V-Driven-by-Profit-Who-Benefits-from-the-“611”-System"><a href="#V-Driven-by-Profit-Who-Benefits-from-the-“611”-System" class="headerlink" title="V. Driven by Profit: Who Benefits from the “611” System?"></a>V. Driven by Profit: Who Benefits from the “611” System?</h2><p>When a system spreads rapidly across the country in just a few years and gains implicit approval from various layers of society, its endurance is rarely based on ideals alone. Instead, it is sustained by a powerful chain of vested interests.</p>
<p>On the surface, the “611 education system” is about students studying and taking mock exams day and night. But beneath that, it functions as a highly efficient economic engine. This systemic exploitation, operating under the banner of education, not only consumes the youth of countless students but also feeds a network of beneficiaries within the education industry.</p>
<p>For schools, extended on-campus hours translate into expanded control. The longer students remain at school, the more they rely on institutional services—meals, dormitories, materials, and more. Many public schools operate their own canteens and convenience stores, turning daily necessities into reliable revenue streams. Some institutions charge additional fees under the guise of “extra classes” or “study materials.” According to online reports, certain elite schools charge each student thousands of yuan in additional expenses per semester—far exceeding the standard tuition.</p>
<p>For private schools, the “Hengshui model” has become a marketable brand. Many private institutions advertise “intensive management and guaranteed score improvements” as selling points, drawing in parents willing to pay top dollar for results. One parent in Jiangsu admitted in an interview that they were paying nearly 100,000 yuan annually for their child to attend a school that follows a semi-Hengshui system:<br><em>“Teachers monitor students closely, and there’s no time to slack off—only then can results be guaranteed.”</em><br>Under this logic, the “611” model is not an aberration, but rather a kind of academic insurance—a commodity purchased to alleviate parental anxiety.</p>
<p>For local governments, educational performance remains a key performance metric. Admission rates to elite universities, provincial rankings, and national exam scores are often treated as political achievements, used to secure funding or career advancement. For officials, a school with high test scores is not just a source of pride, but a tool of image-building and social control. As such, schools adopting the “611” model are often not sanctioned but celebrated, highlighted by media and visited by officials, thereby reinforcing their legitimacy.</p>
<p>Outside the core system lies a shadow economy of tutoring centers, test-prep publishers, and online education platforms. Any industry linked to “performance enhancement” quietly profits from the stress of students and the desperation of parents—reaping stable and lucrative returns.</p>
<p>And the students? They are the most voiceless actors in this systemic game. They lack bargaining power, have no real choices, and are not even given space to say, <em>“I’m tired.”</em> Pushed forward by the machinery of education, they rarely stop to ask: <em>Who is this race for? Where is it taking me?</em></p>
<p>When education is no longer a public good but a performance metric and marketable product, children become passive carriers of adult priorities. Their time and emotions, their bodies and minds—even their dreams and souls—are gradually consumed, traded for social order and institutional profit.</p>
<h2 id="VI-A-Human-Rights-Perspective-Rethinking-the-System"><a href="#VI-A-Human-Rights-Perspective-Rethinking-the-System" class="headerlink" title="VI. A Human Rights Perspective: Rethinking the System"></a>VI. A Human Rights Perspective: Rethinking the System</h2><p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) clearly states in Article 31:<br><em>“States Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child.”</em><br>This legal instrument, effective since 1990 and ratified by China in 1992, aims to ensure that children are treated not as tools, but as whole human beings—worthy of dignity and care.</p>
<p>But when the “611 system” becomes the educational norm, these principles fall silent. When children are forced to wake in darkness and study under fluorescent lights late into the night, endlessly memorizing “essential test content,” can we still say they have the right to rest and leisure?</p>
<p>At a deeper level, the CRC is grounded in the principle of “the best interests of the child”—all decisions and policies concerning children should begin with their well-being. Yet the system built around “611” clearly serves not the child, but test rankings, economic gain, and political performance.</p>
<p>In the international arena, such an education model would face harsh criticism if found elsewhere. Excessive hours, lack of rest, and restricted autonomy may, in some cases, be seen as institutional exploitation or even psychological abuse. According to the United Nations Human Rights Council, a state’s failure to protect children from such pressures may constitute a violation of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>China’s current education practices reveal a troubling gap between legal commitments and actual policies. While the government promotes reforms like the “double reduction policy” (aimed at reducing homework and private tutoring), many regions respond with mere lip service—or even countermeasures: longer in-school hours, lessons disguised as “self-study,” and mounting pressure under a different name.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, this pressure is no longer confined to mainland China. As China exports its educational influence, some overseas Chinese-language and international schools are beginning to adopt similar test-centric models. Just as China’s surveillance technology has spread globally, the “611” education culture may become a silent export—one that not only drains the youth of a nation but also reshapes global perceptions of what education should be.</p>
<p>We must remain vigilant against this trend. When education loses its respect for human dignity, when children are treated as production units for data and competition, even the most efficient system will ultimately lead to a collapse of empathy and creativity.</p>
<p>The international community has both the responsibility and the capacity to respond—with concern, solidarity, and dialogue. And for readers in regions like Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau, the question is urgent:<br>As we worry over university admissions, have we already begun to walk the path of “Hengshui-ization”?<br>And can we build an education system that truly centers the human being—one that resists the invisible erosion of dignity and restores meaning to the word <em>learning</em>?</p>
<h2 id="VII-Conclusion-A-Call-for-Change"><a href="#VII-Conclusion-A-Call-for-Change" class="headerlink" title="VII. Conclusion: A Call for Change"></a>VII. Conclusion: A Call for Change</h2><p>In countless cities across China, in the quiet hours before dawn and long after dusk, there are always children shuffling silently between classrooms and dormitories. Their bodies are small, their eyes weary, their movements mechanical. They likely don’t have time to wonder whether they are happy, nor have they learned how to say, <em>“I don’t want to live like this anymore.”</em> Because in their world, giving up is betrayal, exhaustion is shameful, and obedience is the only praiseworthy virtue.</p>
<p>We have gone too long without asking a simple question:<br><strong>What kind of life does a 14-year-old child deserve?</strong></p>
<p>The terrifying truth about the “611 education system” is not just the extension of hours—it’s the value system it reflects: that a child’s worth lies in how much honor they bring to their family, how many points they earn for their school, how many achievements they add to a local government’s performance metrics. This outcome-driven culture reduces humans to numbers, turns learning into a pressure test, and compresses childhood into a narrow, lonely, and silent marathon.</p>
<p>Of course, we can say that all of this is <em>for the children’s future</em>.<br>But what we rarely dare to confront is this: <strong>By the time that future arrives, have they already lost the basic right to simply be human?</strong></p>
<p>A society becomes the sum of where it chooses to invest. If we continue pouring all educational resources into exams, rankings, and standardized simulations, we will not raise creative, compassionate, or critically thinking citizens—we will raise products of a system designed for endurance, obedience, and suppression. Such a society may look efficient, but it is fragile; it may seem stable, but it has lost its soul.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why change feels so difficult.<br>Teachers cannot resist, because their evaluations and salaries are tied to student performance.<br>Principals cannot take risks, because relaxing the rules may jeopardize the school’s rankings.<br>Parents dare not protest, because they have already wagered everything on their child’s future.<br>And students… often don’t even realize they are being oppressed. They simply feel tired, joyless, and unaware that life could be lived differently.</p>
<p>Systems persist because they convince each person they are powerless to change anything.<br>That is the most insidious part of the “611” regime:<br>It is not enforced by top-down orders, but by collective anxiety and self-perpetuated enslavement. When everyone believes <em>“this is the only way my child can succeed,”</em> then even laws, ethics, and data warning of harm will not stop us from passing the whip to the next hand.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean change is impossible.</p>
<p>True change rarely begins with a policy decree.<br>It begins with individuals asking different questions.</p>
<p>When a teacher decides not to assign meaningless homework.<br>When a parent refuses to enroll their child in endless cram classes.<br>When a student finds the courage to say, <em>“I need rest. I deserve happiness.”</em><br>These voices may be small—but they are enough to shake the silence that has become normalized.</p>
<p>We may not be able to dismantle a deeply rooted system overnight.<br>But we can start by questioning its legitimacy.<br>We can begin to say: <em>“Maybe this model of education was never meant for children.”</em><br>We can rebuild trust—<br>Trust that growth does not come from standard answers alone;<br>That the purpose of education is to guide, not control;<br>That the future should not be purchased with suffering and suppression.</p>
<p>This article is not written to assign blame or spread fear.<br>It is a long-overdue reminder—a letter written on behalf of millions of silent children.<br>They don’t have time to write it themselves. But we can speak for them.</p>
<p>And maybe, one day in the future, we’ll stand outside a classroom and see children running in the sunlight—not because they’re rushing to the next class, but because they finally have time to breathe, to live, to dream.</p>
<p><strong>If that day comes, it will be the most precious freedom our generation has won for the next.</strong></p>
