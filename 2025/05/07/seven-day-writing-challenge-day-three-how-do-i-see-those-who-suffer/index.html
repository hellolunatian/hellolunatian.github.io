<p><strong>Prompt:</strong><br><em>Imagine that you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth—financially free, never needing to worry about money.</em><br><em>How would you view those on this planet who are desperately struggling—through poverty, through war—just to survive, to climb, to compete?</em></p>
<p>This is a difficult question.<br>In my understanding, everything that happens now is predestined.<br>What hasn’t happened is infinite, and I cannot assume a life I have never lived.<br>Still, it’s a worthy question—so I’ll try my best to imagine this hypothetical.</p>
<p>If I were born into wealth—never troubled by bills or survival, free to choose my path—<br>then the suffering I feel might not be less, but greater.<br>Because when I don’t have to worry about my survival,<br>I will begin to worry about everything in this world that still remains unsolved.<br>All the pain that exists in the world will dwell with me—<br>and so, suffering, though distant from me, will not become less bearable.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-world-so-unfair"><a href="#Why-is-the-world-so-unfair" class="headerlink" title="Why is the world so unfair?"></a>Why is the world so unfair?</h3><p>I know this much:<br><strong>Wealth is a gift, not a reward.</strong><br>As a Christian, I cannot simply convince myself that everything is fate.<br>Every abundance I receive is not because I deserve more than others,<br>but because of God’s grace.<br>And that grace is calling me to see the struggles of others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it,<br>why do you boast as though you did not?”<br>— <em>1 Corinthians 4:7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This humbles me.<br>It does not make me proud; it fills me with reverence.<br>What God has entrusted to me is not mine to possess, but mine to steward.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="The-pain-of-others-is-my-calling"><a href="#The-pain-of-others-is-my-calling" class="headerlink" title="The pain of others is my calling."></a>The pain of others is my calling.</h3><p>Refugees fleeing war,<br>laborers struggling below the poverty line,<br>those silenced in the cracks of the system—<br>they are not just numbers.<br>They are not just headlines.<br>They are living, breathing people.<br>And their existence is asking me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If God placed me where I am today,<br>then what should I do?<br>How should I act?<br>How should I respond?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never say, “They’re just unlucky.”<br>Instead, I’ll ask:<br><strong>Is God showing them to me for a reason?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was hungry and you gave me something to eat,<br>I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,<br>I was a stranger and you invited me in.”<br>— <em>Matthew 25:35</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I only enjoy and do not share,<br>then I am the rich man watching coldly, not the friend of Lazarus.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="My-blessings-will-come-with-a-burden-of-responsibility"><a href="#My-blessings-will-come-with-a-burden-of-responsibility" class="headerlink" title="My blessings will come with a burden of responsibility."></a>My blessings will come with a burden of responsibility.</h3><p>I will be grateful for all that I have—<br>but I will never be content in comfort.<br>Not because wealth is inherently sinful,<br>but because <strong>the more I am given, the more I owe</strong>.</p>
<p>I will use what I have—my resources, my skills—<br>to grow in capacity,<br>so I can help more people.</p>
<p>I will ask myself:<br><strong>Am I willing to see the suffering of others?</strong><br>I have seen it.<br>Now that I’ve seen it,<br>I cannot pretend I don’t know.</p>
<p>I want to be the one who helps.<br>I want to grow stronger—<br>not to rise above others,<br>but because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded;<br>and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”<br>— <em>Luke 12:48</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I still have this same soul,<br>then I believe I still have the same duty:<br>to witness, to walk alongside, to reach out and share.<br>I too have been crushed by injustice.<br>I know what it’s like to be forgotten by the world,<br>to be oppressed by a system,<br>to be drowned in a label.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="That-pain-has-made-me-a-bridge"><a href="#That-pain-has-made-me-a-bridge" class="headerlink" title="That pain has made me a bridge."></a>That pain has made me a bridge.</h3><p>A bridge between myself and those who suffer.<br>If I hold a silver spoon in my hand,<br>I hope I use it—<br>not to fill my own bowl,<br>but to serve those whose bowls have been empty for years.<br>Not out of charity,<br>but because we are all created equal,<br>equally loved, equally human.</p>
<p>If I truly lacked nothing,<br>then I could finally stand up for those who lack everything.<br>I would use my wealth to support those in genuine need.<br>I would lift up the organizations I believe in,<br>devote time to education and care,<br>and use my influence to speak for justice—<br>to fight for it—<br>just as I’m doing today.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="So-to-return-to-the-question"><a href="#So-to-return-to-the-question" class="headerlink" title="So, to return to the question:"></a>So, to return to the question:</h3><p><strong>How would I see them?</strong><br>I would see them through the lens of a soul that cannot look away.<br>I wouldn’t see them as victims of “social problems.”<br>I wouldn’t treat their lives as background noise in the news.<br>I would see them as my brothers and sisters—<br>made in the image of God,<br>with dignity and soul.</p>
<p>Their suffering is not a separate kind of life—<br>it is a reality that my life must respond to.</p>
<p>I would look at their struggles with reverence.<br>Because I know:<br><strong>those who survive suffering<br>are stronger and braver than I am.</strong></p>
<p>I would look with compassion—<br>not just sympathy,<br>but a will to walk alongside.</p>
<p>If their lives are spent fighting to stay alive,<br>then mine has no right to be lived lazily.</p>
