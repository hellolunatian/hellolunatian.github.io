<p>If I were the little match girl,<br>I wouldn’t light that last match.<br>Because even in the darkness, I’d still want to know—<br>is someone waiting for me?</p>
<p>If I truly lived like her—trapped in extreme poverty, with no one to help—<br>then I wouldn’t have dreams.<br>I wouldn’t think about the future.<br>Because in that moment, I’d only have one question:<br><strong>How do I survive today?</strong></p>
<p>In Hans Christian Andersen’s tale, the girl’s death feels like an inevitable fate.<br>She lives in utter destitution, abandoned by society, alone on a freezing street.<br>This story isn’t fantasy—it’s a brutal mirror, reflecting the indifference and injustice of 19th-century Europe.</p>
<p>For her, survival isn’t just a word—it’s a daily torment.<br>Hunger, cold, and violence define her world.<br>Even if she sold every match, she’d only return to a home filled with fear.<br>Day after day, she would roam the streets, pleading with strangers.<br>To die might even seem like a release.</p>
<p>Let’s go back for a moment—back to 19th-century Denmark.<br>The urban poor were trapped at the bottom of society.<br>She would have had no education, no job prospects—she was only a child—<br>and could only trade matches for scraps of food.<br>Even in a Christian Europe, where heaven was hoped for,<br>people ignored the suffering right in front of them.</p>
<p>She didn’t fear the cold as much as she feared going home.<br>She feared the beatings.<br>And yet, she had no choice.<br>No legal protection.<br>No right to even ask for help.</p>
<p>Her only hope was the kindness of strangers.<br>Maybe—just maybe—she’d gather the courage to walk into a church, a convent,<br>or a rare charitable organization.<br>If she was lucky, perhaps she’d be taken in by one of the few orphanages of the time.<br>The conditions would be harsh, the discipline strict,<br>but it would still be warmer than the streets.</p>
<p>She might learn how to wash clothes, to sew, to pray.<br>She might meet other girls discarded by the world.<br>And if she made it a few more years, gained some basic skills,<br>maybe she could work as a maid in a wealthy household or in a textile factory.<br>If she saved up a little, perhaps she could buy a used sewing machine<br>and open a small tailor shop—<br>making clothes for workers and widows, maybe even patching torn garments for free.</p>
<p>And if one day she saw another shivering girl on the corner,<br>she might gently ask:<br><strong>“Are you cold? Do you want to come warm up with me?”</strong></p>
<p>That’s the gentlest, most fragile of dreams.</p>
<hr>
<p>But what if I were her—and I lived today?<br>Would there be more possibilities?</p>
<p>Maybe I’d sneak my father’s phone,<br>connect to the mall’s free Wi-Fi,<br>and catch a glimpse of another kind of life.<br>Maybe I’d see short videos from homeless youth,<br>or posts teaching people how to escape abusive homes.</p>
<p>I might read the comments:<br>“Call the police.”<br>“Find a social worker—they’ll help you.”</p>
<p>And maybe, I’d gather the courage to walk into a police station.<br>To ask for help.<br>If I were in Denmark,<br>maybe—just maybe—there’d be a real chance.</p>
<p>But if I were a girl in China,<br>things might not be so simple.</p>
<p>If I tried to report abuse,<br>the police might call it a “family matter”<br>and tell me to “go home and resolve your conflicts.”<br>If I found a social worker,<br>they might say, “You don’t belong to this district.”<br>If I had no <em>hukou</em>—no household registration—<br>getting into an orphanage would be near impossible.<br>And if I ran away,<br>I might be labeled a “problem child”<br>and thrown into juvenile detention.</p>
<p>The thresholds of law are too high.<br>The cracks in the system are too deep.<br>And no one wants to open the door<br>for a child with no background,<br>no papers,<br>and no voice.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>But I would still want to live.</strong></p>
<p>I’d search online for underground support networks—<br>those small shelters built by runaway teens, marginalized souls,<br>and adults willing to walk beside them.<br>Maybe I’d post anonymously, make videos,<br>try to let the world hear me.</p>
<p>Maybe someone would send donations,<br>or at least tell me what to do next.<br>Maybe I’d live in a repurposed warehouse turned into a temporary shelter,<br>sweeping floors, cooking meals in exchange for a bed.</p>
<p>I’d learn to survive in the city:<br>collecting bottles, washing dishes, delivering food,<br>avoiding eviction.<br>Maybe even editing short videos on my phone,<br>telling my story on TikTok or Xiaohongshu.</p>
<p>Life would be hard.<br>But I’d start to understand something:<br><strong>Not everyone will help me—<br>but someone will.</strong></p>
<p>What truly helps me stand again<br>wouldn’t be a one-time donation.<br>It would be the slow accumulation of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A skill that can feed me.  </li>
<li>An identity I no longer deny.  </li>
<li>A life story that earns respect and understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I have these,<br>I wouldn’t just be surviving—<br>I’d be creating value.<br>For myself, and for others.</p>
<p>If I made it that far,<br>I’d want to help others like me.<br>I could teach them how to survive the city,<br>how to avoid danger,<br>how to recognize kindness.</p>
<p>I could reply to their comments,<br>collect second-hand goods,<br>deliver tents and hot water.<br>And when I’m older,<br>I might still wash dishes, sew, deliver takeout, or fix phones—<br>not because that’s all I can do,<br>but because I’ve chosen not to disappear.</p>
<hr>
<p>These paths are narrow.<br>But they are still paths.<br>And as long as I live,<br>a little light will always find a way through the cracks.</p>
