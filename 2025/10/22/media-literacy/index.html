<p>Today, the question we face may not be <em>“What can we still trust?”</em> but rather, <em>“How can we live responsibly in an age where truth itself is unstable?”</em>  </p>
<p>AI, like every other transformative technology, has no reverse gear. Once it starts, it doesn’t stop. The line between the real and the artificial will only continue to blur as AI-generated content multiplies.  </p>
<p>Perhaps media literacy programs, which we keep reading about, embody a belief — that education can help people reclaim control over truth.<br>But maybe the point is not about <strong>control</strong>, but about <strong>coexistence</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="I-The-Pope-in-a-Puffer-Jacket"><a href="#I-The-Pope-in-a-Puffer-Jacket" class="headerlink" title="I. The Pope in a Puffer Jacket"></a>I. The Pope in a Puffer Jacket</h2><p>I still remember one of the most striking pieces of news from March 2023:<br>Pope Francis appeared online wearing a white Balenciaga puffer coat.  </p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/pope.png" width="80%">
  <br>
  <em>Fake photos of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket.</em>
</p>

<p>The photo made me laugh. There he was, calm and dignified, walking down the street in that voluminous, glossy jacket — a sharp contrast to his usual modest robes. The coat was beautiful, its fabric full and rich in texture.  </p>
<p>Within hours, the image went viral, shared millions of times. Some people laughed like I did; some discussed the Catholic Church’s public image strategy; others admired the outfit, even asking me whether I’d consider buying one.<br>For a moment, I honestly thought it was part of a marketing campaign.  </p>
<p>Later, I learned that the image was created by a construction worker in Chicago. He had simply typed a few words into Midjourney — “Pope,” “Balenciaga,” “street photo.” Seconds later, the algorithm produced it: the lighting perfect, the texture of the coat realistic, even the Pope’s slightly hunched posture eerily convincing.</p>
<p>Three days later, fact-checking organizations confirmed that it was AI-generated.<br>But by then, the image had already been reprinted by thousands of media outlets, discussed endlessly online. In some sense, it had already <em>become an event.</em></p>
<p>I noticed one user on Twitter who asked:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If even this is fake, what can we still believe in?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time, I didn’t have an answer.<br>Eight months later, UNESCO published the <em>Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms</em> — a document that tried to impose order on our chaotic digital landscape.  </p>
<p>Its core recommendations could be summarized as three principles:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Foster critical thinking  </li>
<li>Promote fact-checking  </li>
<li>Urge platforms to label AI-generated content</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn to distinguish the true from the false — and you can remain clear-minded amid AI’s illusions. That was its logic.</p>
<p>The first time I read this document was in May last year, while finishing a term paper. It was nearly summer; everything felt heavy; I was in a bad mood — and, as luck would have it, it was raining.  </p>
<p>Still, I found the document well written. I’ve always had a soft spot for texts filled with goodwill and idealism.<br>But I stopped at page nineteen.  </p>
<p>There, it said: platforms should be <em>urged</em> to label AI-generated content. Not <em>required</em>, not <em>mandated</em>, but <em>urged</em> — a word so polite it’s nearly transparent.  </p>
<p>That night, out of boredom, I opened ChatGPT and asked it to generate a short paragraph about media literacy, citing three academic papers.  </p>
<p>It responded instantly: eloquent prose, coherent structure, three papers listed with author names, titles, and journal names.  </p>
<p>When I checked the references, none of them existed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time, and yet I couldn’t help laughing. The authors’ names were real; the journals were real; the paper titles sounded perfectly plausible — but the works themselves had never been written.  </p>
<p>I asked the AI to describe these “papers.”<br>Its made-up arguments sometimes sounded more persuasive than real scholarship — as if they existed somewhere in a parallel universe, waiting to be cited. The thought sent a shiver through me.</p>
<p>So, is our biggest challenge still <em>“how to tell true from false”</em>?<br>I think not. The real question is: <strong>what counts as truth?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="II-The-Illusion-of-Stability"><a href="#II-The-Illusion-of-Stability" class="headerlink" title="II. The Illusion of Stability"></a>II. The Illusion of Stability</h2><p>If we look back — and “back” may mean only two years ago now — UNESCO’s guidelines were born in a peculiar moment of history.  </p>
<p>Let’s return to 2023: ChatGPT had just entered the public eye; Midjourney images were flooding social media; governments worldwide were scrambling to respond.<br>UNESCO’s chosen path was the familiar one: education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Empowering users — including through media and information literacy education — is fundamental to countering disinformation and promoting healthy online participation,”<br>the document reads on page eleven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a familiar logic.<br>It assumes the problem lies with the user — not as a form of blame, but as a premise: if people can be made smarter and more critical, then they can resist misinformation.  </p>
<p>Learn critical thinking, practice fact-checking, and you’ll survive the data flood.  </p>
<p>But the language of the document is telling. Words like “should,” “encourage,” and “promote” abound, while “must” and “require” are scarce.  </p>
<p>When it comes to platform responsibility, the tone becomes almost evasive.<br>In discussing algorithmic transparency, the text suggests that platforms <em>“should consider”</em> disclosing information about their recommendation systems.</p>
<p><em>Should consider</em> — meaning, of course, they could also <em>not</em> consider it.</p>
<p>I closed my laptop and went for a walk, still thinking about what the document <em>didn’t</em> say.<br>What happens when there are no penalties, no oversight bodies, no accountability?<br>What if platforms simply choose not to label AI content?<br>If algorithms remain opaque, who is responsible?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the document is silent on that.</p>
<p>I recalled a Zoom conference I once attended. A policymaker said on stage:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must empower every citizen to distinguish truth from falsehood.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thunderous applause followed.  </p>
<p>During the Q&amp;A, a woman introduced herself as a high school teacher and asked:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If my students barely have time to finish their homework, how much time should they spend verifying the news every day?”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moments later, I logged out.<br>The panelists praised her “excellent question,” promised to “add more class hours,” and moved on.<br>I stood by the library window. It was already getting dark.  </p>
<p>Let’s imagine, then, a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a responsible citizen.<br>You follow every UNESCO recommendation.</p>
<p>One day, you read a piece of news: a certain government is secretly developing a new weapon.<br>You check the author’s profile — it looks legitimate.<br>You search for corroboration — several small media outlets have reported the same.<br>You find documents that look official.<br>You cross-check multiple sources. Everything aligns.  </p>
<p>So, you share it.</p>
<p>Three days later, a fact-checking organization announces that it was a coordinated disinformation campaign.<br>Those “small media outlets” were fabricated. The “official documents” were AI-generated.<br>The “ordinary user” was a bot.<br>The entire event was an AI-driven, multilayered illusion.</p>
<p>As I once wrote in another essay, <em>“Things That Look Like News,”</em> — a text that <em>looks</em> like journalism feels trustworthy. Likewise, something that <em>looks</em> like truth can bypass our verification instincts.</p>
<p>You did everything right. You followed every guideline.<br>And still, you were fooled.</p>
<p>Because the rules of the game have changed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="III-After-the-Enlightenment"><a href="#III-After-the-Enlightenment" class="headerlink" title="III. After the Enlightenment"></a>III. After the Enlightenment</h2><p>The French philosopher Antoinette Rouvroy once introduced a concept called <strong>“algorithmic governmentality”</strong> during a talk at the <em>Society of the Query</em> conference.  </p>
<p>She explained it simply:<br>In the digital age, power no longer operates by issuing orders; it operates by shaping environments.<br>Platforms don’t have to tell you what to see — they just adjust the algorithms, and you’ll naturally see what they want you to see.</p>
<p>So, does media literacy still matter?</p>
<p>Maybe.<br>But if it only teaches you how to find your way out of a maze without ever asking <em>why the maze exists</em>, it risks becoming another tool of governance.<br>Education should teach us to question and to critique.</p>
<p>What does an ideal human being look like?<br>Perhaps rational, autonomous, capable of independent judgment — the Enlightenment model of <em>Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am”</em> and <em>Kant’s “Dare to know.”</em>  </p>
<p>In that tradition, humans are subjects; technology is a tool. The boundary between them is clear.  </p>
<p>But does that boundary still exist?</p>
<hr>
<p>These days, I have new habits that I never used to have.<br>When I hit a wall in writing, I used to email a trusted friend or text a kind professor. We’d discuss ideas, and I’d often come away inspired.<br>It slowed my writing, but those conversations were warm and human. I remember the office hours that turned into dinners at favorite restaurants. I’ve never been a solitary writer; I like the feeling of thinking <em>with</em> others.</p>
<p>ChatGPT has changed that.<br>Although I avoid using AI in my essays or academic work, I still appreciate its instant feedback — the kind that comes without judgment or social weight.<br>Sometimes I ask it questions, seek suggestions, explore threads of thought.  </p>
<p>But mid-conversation, I often pause and wonder: <em>Who is writing this?</em><br>Is it me, or the AI?<br>Or have we, somehow, co-authored something?</p>
<p>I recall reading the literary theorist N. Katherine Hayles, who developed the concept of the <strong>“posthuman.”</strong><br>She observed that our thinking, memory, and judgment are now so deeply embedded in technical systems that it’s nearly impossible to say where the human ends and the machine begins.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up reading science fiction, I once found that idea exciting.<br>Now that I’m living it, I’m not sure whether to call it a privilege or a tragedy.</p>
<p>Hayles wrote:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The question is not how to resist AI’s influence, but how to remain ethical, reflective, and responsible within a state of coexistence.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditional media literacy teaches us to be better <em>independent judges</em>.<br>But what if judgment itself is no longer an independent act?<br>If AI not only transmits information but shapes how we perceive the world — does “independent judgment” still mean anything?</p>
<p>A few days ago, I called a classmate who studies the philosophy of AI.<br>I told him about my anxiety — about how overwhelming this all feels — and asked what troubled him most about large language models.  </p>
<p>He thought for a while and said:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They’re not reproducing human knowledge. They’re generating a new kind of knowledge.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.  </p>
<p>“Traditionally,” he said, “knowledge comes from evidence, experience, reasoning. A statement is true because it corresponds to reality.<br>But GPT doesn’t work that way. It calculates statistical relationships between words. It predicts which sentences sound plausible.<br>The result is something neither true nor false — just <em>apparently believable</em>.”  </p>
<p>I told him about the fake citations ChatGPT had produced for me.<br>He said, “That’s not deception in the traditional sense. It’s a new form of production. It’s not giving you lies — it’s giving you <em>possibilities</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="IV-What-Do-We-Need"><a href="#IV-What-Do-We-Need" class="headerlink" title="IV. What Do We Need?"></a>IV. What Do We Need?</h2><p>There’s no simple answer.<br>But perhaps we can begin by reframing the question.</p>
<p>Not “Is this true or false?” — but  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How was this created?”<br>Not “How can I identify AI content?” — but<br>“How is AI shaping the way I think?”<br>Not “How do I protect myself?” — but<br>“How do we collectively build a more transparent environment?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires a new kind of awareness.</p>
<p>First, a reflective mindset.<br>It may be hard to reject AI entirely in daily life, but staying conscious while using it is still possible.<br>When you ask ChatGPT to help write an email, when you accept algorithmic news recommendations, when you feel convinced by a well-written post — pause. Step back. Ask yourself:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does this feel trustworthy?<br>Because it makes sense? Or because it aligns with what I already want to believe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not about one-time fact-checking. It’s about cultivating a state of ongoing dialogue — a kind of <strong>awareness</strong>.  </p>
<p>Even if you’re co-creating meaning with AI, you can still remain conscious of that process.</p>
<p>Then, there’s systems thinking.<br>Information doesn’t appear out of nowhere. It is produced, filtered, and circulated within complex technological, economic, and political systems.<br>When you read a headline that begins with <em>“Studies show…”</em>, don’t just ask whether the study exists — ask:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who funded this study?<br>Where did the data come from?<br>Why is this narrative being amplified <em>now</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some technical literacy is also helpful.<br>You don’t need to learn how to code, but understanding the basics helps:  </p>
<ul>
<li>How do recommendation algorithms determine what we see?  </li>
<li>Why do language models hallucinate?  </li>
<li>How does training data shape AI bias?</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t need technical mastery.<br>We need <strong>power literacy</strong> — to understand <em>who</em> shapes our information environment, and <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>But most important of all: we must shift from <strong>individual responsibility</strong> to <strong>collective action</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how smart you are as an individual, you can’t fight systemic manipulation alone.<br>You may learn to detect fake news. But if an algorithm is pushing carefully designed disinformation to a billion users every day — your personal resistance won’t be enough.</p>
<p>We need a concept of <strong>digital citizenship</strong>.<br>The right to know what algorithms are doing to you.<br>The right to control how your data is used.<br>The right to demand explanations when AI systems make decisions that affect your life.<br>The right to opt out of personalized recommendations.  </p>
<p>These aren’t gifts from tech companies.<br>They are <strong>rights</strong> — to be won through legislation, regulation, and collective negotiation.</p>
<p>The EU is already experimenting.<br>The <strong>AI Act</strong> passed in 2024 mandates that high-risk AI systems must be explainable and human-supervised.<br>The <strong>Digital Services Act</strong> gives users the right to opt out of personalization, and forces major platforms to explain their algorithmic logic to regulators.</p>
<p>These laws are imperfect, their enforcement full of challenges.<br>But they acknowledge one essential truth: <strong>we cannot place all responsibility on the user</strong>.</p>
<p>Some say the EU is too conservative.<br>But I think there’s value in trying to pull the reins.</p>
<p>Of course, legislation always lags behind.<br>By the time we’re regulating GPT-4, GPT-5 is already here.<br>But that’s not a reason to give up — it’s a reason to act faster, and smarter.</p>
<p>The hardest question to ignore is: <strong>what responsibility do the platforms bear?</strong></p>
<p>Why are we always talking about “educating users,”<br>but almost never about <strong>regulating platforms</strong>?</p>
<p>If a food company sells toxic food, we don’t say, <em>“Consumers should learn to detect poison.”</em><br>But in the digital world, we’ve accepted a strange logic: platforms can design systems that spread lies — then blame the user for believing them.</p>
<p>That logic must be challenged.<br>Algorithms decide what gets seen, amplified, and recommended.<br>If that’s editorial power, then <strong>editorial responsibility must follow</strong>.</p>
<p>Concretely:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms must make recommendation algorithms transparent to regulators.  </li>
<li>If disinformation causes real-world harm, platforms should be held legally accountable.  </li>
<li>Users should have the right to opt out of personalization.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for <em>“AI-generated content must be labeled”</em> — honestly, that may be the most difficult goal of all.</p>
<p>There are enormous technical challenges.<br>Who decides what counts as “AI-generated”?<br>What if a text is 50% AI-written, 50% human-edited — does it count?<br>And what about enforcement? Anonymous uploads? Cross-border platforms?</p>
<p>Maybe perfection isn’t the goal.<br>Maybe the goal is <strong>procedural justice</strong>.</p>
<p>In high-risk domains — journalism, medicine, legal documents — disclosure of AI use should be mandatory.<br>Platforms can offer creators labeling tools.<br>We can invest in detection technologies — though it may become an endless arms race.</p>
<p>The point is not to design a perfect system,<br>but to <strong>stop offloading all the burden onto individuals</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="V-Living-in-the-Flow"><a href="#V-Living-in-the-Flow" class="headerlink" title="V. Living in the Flow"></a>V. Living in the Flow</h2><p>As I write this, it’s not raining — but it is windy.<br>The temperature dropped nearly five degrees today.<br>I might need my down jacket tomorrow.</p>
<p>Speaking of jackets…<br>That image of the Pope in the puffer coat comes back to me.<br>It looked so real. I even thought it was brand marketing. But it wasn’t. It was misinformation.  </p>
<p>And when people found out, they didn’t get angry.<br>They got confused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If even this is fake, what can we still believe in?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that question itself is flawed.</p>
<p>The point isn’t <em>what</em> we can still believe in —<br>but <em>how</em> we live <strong>ethically in an age where truth is fluid</strong>.</p>
<p>Like all technology, AI can’t be un-invented.<br>We’re heading into a future where content will be increasingly generated,<br>and the line between fact and fiction will continue to dissolve.  </p>
<p>We cannot return to a time when truth was clear —<br>and perhaps that time never existed.</p>
<p>Even before AI, we were already surrounded by misinformation.</p>
<p>Still, I believe UNESCO’s media literacy framework represents a sincere conviction —<br>a belief that education can help us regain control over truth.</p>
<p>But <strong>control</strong> is not the answer.<br><strong>Coexistence</strong> is.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean abandoning judgment.<br>It means cultivating a <strong>more complex kind of literacy</strong> —<br>one that reflects while using AI, questions the logic of production,<br>and seeks <strong>collective change</strong> beyond personal efforts.</p>
<p>It means recognizing that while we can no longer stand <em>outside</em> technology,<br>we can still remain <strong>awake within it</strong>.</p>
<p>Last fall, while giving a presentation, a student sighed and said,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It sounds like we can’t be sure of anything anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought for a moment and replied:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not that nothing can be certain. It’s that the <em>way</em> we become certain has changed.<br>We used to say something was true because it matched reality.<br>Now, we say something is credible because we understand <em>how</em> it was created, <em>why</em>, and <em>by whom</em>.<br>That kind of certainty is more fragile — but perhaps more honest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She nodded, not entirely convinced, and walked out.<br>I was left alone in the hallway. The boats at the dock were glowing orange in the dusk.</p>
<p>AI is redefining knowledge, truth, and reality.<br>We can participate in that process — not as passive users,<br>but as empowered citizens, as co-creators of meaning.  </p>
<p>What we need is not a better truth-detector,<br>but the <strong>ability to swim in a sea of shifting truths</strong>.  </p>
<p>Not to fight the current,<br>but to understand its direction, know our position within it,<br>and choose where we want to go.</p>
<p>It won’t be easy.<br>But this is the survival skill we must now learn.</p>

<h2 id="Epilogue"><a href="#Epilogue" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2><p>The streetlights are on.<br>I pack up my things and step out of the library.<br>The air after the rain smells clean.<br>People walk past me, heads down, their screens glowing.  </p>
<p>I take out my own phone, open a news app.<br>The algorithm has already curated today’s world for me.</p>

<h2 id="A-Note-on-This-Essay"><a href="#A-Note-on-This-Essay" class="headerlink" title="A Note on This Essay"></a>A Note on This Essay</h2><p>This piece originated from a final paper I wrote during the summer term.<br>I’m grateful to my professor for offering such thought-provoking prompts.<br>(Though yes, the academic pressure was real 😅.)</p>
<p>Six months later, I revisited the topic with fresh thoughts and wanted to share a revised version here.<br>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering: <em>What can I do now?</em></p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using ChatGPT, pay attention to how its responses shape your thinking.</li>
<li>When you see a piece of news, ask not just <em>“Is this true?”</em> but also <em>“Who is saying this, and why now?”</em></li>
<li>Check your app settings — see how your feed is being personalized.</li>
<li>Pick up an introductory book on AI.</li>
<li>Follow your country’s legislative discussions on AI regulation.</li>
<li>Talk to your friends and family about how they use AI.<br>(Or drop me a message — I’d love to hear from you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re an educator, consider how to integrate “understanding AI” into your curriculum.<br>If you’re a policymaker, push for stronger platform accountability.<br>If you’re just a regular person, like me — remember:<br><strong>You have the right to demand a more transparent, more just digital world.</strong></p>
<p>All change begins with a question.</p>
